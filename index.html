                <p> 
                    <li>
                        This is a simple 2d game where the challenge for the player is to activate the red path finding the best
                            cardinal way to kill the enemy AI. And enemy also will be activating a cyan color path which will be
                            challenging for the player to dodge or to be in the safe zone.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Here I used graph data structure to get the shortest path used queue to keep the upcoming shapes in
                            queue and then release it in next mode.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Here I used stack data structure too in some case we needed.

                    <li>
                        Most importantly this project is made within 24 hours and this project is made in 24 hours as challenge
                            for me to do development continuously for 1 day without taking rest or taking minimal rest to push my
                            ability.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In this game I have added 3 types of game mode that are: - Player vs Computer, Player vs Player and
                            Realtime Online Multiplayer too(Under Progress).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The game is simple to play that is the players have to hide there cats and dogs in some positions of in
                            the grid and the enemy player have to guess the exact position of the player.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I will suggest to play the Player versus Player mode with your local offline friends and have fun and AI
                                will be completly become smart in future also multiplayer will also be implemented very soon.

                        This is created like it will be able to predict any numerical column of an imported dataset.

                    <li>
                        Its is created at that time while I was learning the AI,ML and Data Science for the very first time.

                            And if a number is misplaced then the number indicator will become red. Whereas bydefault it is blue in
